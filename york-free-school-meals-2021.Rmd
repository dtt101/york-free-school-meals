# Task

What can we learn about child poverty in York from published free school meals data?

# Data Sources

Data Source: https://data.yorkopendata.org/dataset/free-school-meals/resource/03b0ae33-f6fe-4431-94f8-4b811c8921ba

# Data Preparation & Processing

 * FSMTaken stops being recorded in 2018
 * Schools are recorded multiple times with different names
 * 9999 is used as a value for FSMTaken and TotalFSM when count <5 upto 2017; https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21187603/replace-characters-from-a-column-of-a-data-frame-r
 * TotalFSM is a <chr> 

# Analysis

Load core libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)  #helps wrangle data
library(ggplot2)  #helps visualize data
```

Load data:

```{r}
fsmraw <- read_csv("csv/fsmdetails.csv")
```

Remove FSMTaken as it stops being recorded in 2018:

```{r}
fsmdetails <- fsmraw %>% select(-FSMTaken)
```

Create pivot table 

```{r}
fsmdetails %>%
  group_by(SchoolName, Year) %>%
  summarise(SchoolName)

```

## Make school names consistent with the latest (2020)

```{r}
fsmdetails$SchoolName[fsmdetails$SchoolName == "All Saints RC"] <- "All Saints RC School"
```


```{r}
oldSchool = c(
  "All Saints RC",

## Replace values <5 and 9999 for 2 in TotalFSM

I have opted for 2 as a replacement value because it is the median of the value of less than 5.

```{r}
fsmdetails$TotalFSM[fsmdetails$TotalFSM == '9999'] <- '2'
fsmdetails$TotalFSM[fsmdetails$TotalFSM == '<5'] <- '2'
```

## Change TotalFSM from <chr> to <int>

```{r}
fsmdetails$TotalFSM <- as.numeric(as.character(fsmdetails$TotalFSM))
```
