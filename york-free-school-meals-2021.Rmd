# Task

What can we learn about changes in school meal uptake in York from published free school meals data?

# Data Sources

Data Source: <https://data.yorkopendata.org/dataset/free-school-meals/resource/03b0ae33-f6fe-4431-94f8-4b811c8921ba>

The data is published annually by York City Council, UK.

# Data Preparation & Processing

-   FSMTaken stops being recorded in 2018
-   Schools are recorded multiple times with different names
-   9999 is used as a value for FSMTaken and TotalFSM when count \<5 upto 2017; <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21187603/replace-characters-from-a-column-of-a-data-frame-r>
-   TotalFSM is a <chr>
-   Need to a add a new column showing TotalFSM as a percentage of TotalPupils

# Analysis

Load core libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)  #helps wrangle data
library(ggplot2)  #helps visualize data
```

Load data:

```{r}
fsmraw <- read_csv("csv/fsmdetails.csv")
```

Remove FSMTaken column as it stops being recorded in 2018:

```{r}
fsmdetails <- fsmraw %>% select(-FSMTaken)
```

Create pivot table to summarise data, making visual checking easier

```{r}
fsmdetails %>%
  group_by(SchoolName, Year, TotalFSMPercentage) %>%
  summarise(SchoolName)

```

## Make school names consistent with the latest (2020)

```{r}
fsmdetails$SchoolName[fsmdetails$SchoolName == "All Saints RC"] <- "All Saints RC School"
```

```{r}

renameSchools <- cbind(oldSchool, newSchool)
for(i in 1:nrow(renameSchools)) {
  oldName = renameSchools[i,][1]
  newName  = renameSchools[i,][2]
  fsmdetails$SchoolName[fsmdetails$SchoolName == oldName] <- newName
}
```

## Replace values \<5 and 9999 for 2 in TotalFSM

I have opted for 2 as a replacement value because it is the median of the value of less than 5.

```{r}
fsmdetails$TotalFSM[fsmdetails$TotalFSM == '9999'] <- '2'
fsmdetails$TotalFSM[fsmdetails$TotalFSM == '<5'] <- '2'
```

## Change TotalFSM from <chr> to <int>

```{r}
fsmdetails$TotalFSM <- as.numeric(as.character(fsmdetails$TotalFSM))
```

## Add in new column to show TotalFSM as a percentage of TotalPupils

```{r}
fsmdetails$TotalFSMPercentage <- (fsmdetails$TotalFSM / fsmdetails$TotalPupils) * 100
```

## Transform data from long to wide

```{r}
library("reshape2")
fsmWide <- dcast(fsmdetails, SchoolName ~ Year, value.var="TotalFSMPercentage")
```

## Export to CSV for use in other tools

```{r}
write.csv(fsmdetails,"~/Downloads/fsmdetails.csv", row.names = TRUE)
```

# Key findings

Calculate mean values for each year, ignoring schools with N/A

```{r}
# Average percentage change
fsmWide2 <- na.omit(fsmWide)
mean(fsmWide2$`2014`)
mean(fsmWide2$`2015`)
mean(fsmWide2$`2016`)
mean(fsmWide2$`2017`)
mean(fsmWide2$`2018`)
mean(fsmWide2$`2019`)
mean(fsmWide2$`2020`)

```

# Supporting visualisations

Multiple line plot for each school, showing trends over time

```{r}
ggplot(fsmdetails, aes(x = Year, y = TotalFSMPercentage)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = SchoolName), size = 1)  + 
  theme_minimal()
```

# Top 3 Recommendations

# Reflections

1.  Next time count school name occurances to make normalising them easier
